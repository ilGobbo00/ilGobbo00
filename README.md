Hi everyone, I'm Riccardo Gobbo a italian guy who is attracted from all technology and scientific fields. 
I'm in the third year of a course in IT Engineering Bachelor degree hosted by the Univerity of Padua. Even if I don't have much experience, I love all the world of cybersecurity and sometimes I try to improve my skills trying some challenges.

I love coocking and I love sports, and have fun with my friends and probably it's for these reasons that I'm not a full stack master developer :')

P.S. If you had the opportunity to read my code or what I wrote, you understood you have to be patient with my english, unfortunatelly I'm not a C2 but I'm trying to do my best :)
